TODO:
- accepting or denying team request should have modal confirmation
- assumes that victim and target teams exist in kill and kill confirmation frontend

- require that user has a team before going to team_request#new
- fix current_user being assumed in /teams

- change kill_confirmation/ so that it shows only kills where you were either the killer or vicitm
  - if you are the owner, you can see everything.

- wrap all tables in <div class="table-responsive"> to make them responsive
